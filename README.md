# pakoroids
A place where Pakoroids can transform from dreams to reality.... 

To run:

  1. run npm install in game directory. (Hopefully should install everything needed)
  2. run bower install to get the rest.
  3. Type: "gulp" which will hopefully start up the local web server.
  4. Navigate to http://localhost:9000/index.html to view game. (Any code edits should update and be viewable after a page refresh)
